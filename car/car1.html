              <br> <p>Maruti Suzuki Dealership & Service Centres Apart from a wide array of cars, Maruti Suzuki also has the widest network of all carmakers in India.</p> 
               <p> The carmaker has two types of dealerships - Arena and Nexa. Nexa is the premium chain of Maruti Suzuki's retail outlets in India.</p>
