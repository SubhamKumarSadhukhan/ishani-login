              <br> <p> Started by Elon Musk in 2003, Tesla is an American all-electric car manufacturer that has been on a growth spree for the past decade. The company's first car, the Tesla Roadster, was introduced in 2008 to showcase the capabilities of an all-electric car. The Roadster used the bodyshell of the Lotus Elise sports car and came with an all-electric battery pack that was claimed to deliver a range of 200 miles (around 320km). Later, Tesla launched its first completely in-house developed car - the Model S sedan in 2012, and followed it with the Model X SUV in 2015, while expanding its footprint in the global passenger market. The most affordable Tesla, the Model 3, was unveiled in 2017 and is currently in high demand, with a waiting period of around 12 months. As a part of its global expansion, Tesla has been interested in entering the Indian market, though no specific plans or timelines have been revealed yet.Tesla offers 5 car available for sale in India. Upcoming Tesla Cars that are expected to launch in 2020/2021 include Model S, Model 3, Model X.</p>

                       <p> The Tesla Model S has been the flagship model for the brand and has been helping Tesla beat its competition such as the BMW 7-Series, Audi A8 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class in not only the United States but also in the European markets on several occasions. The electric sedan with the liftback design form is available in a choice of three variants- 75D, 100D and the P100D which is the top of the line. The P100D in its ludicrous mode can do a 100kmph from a standstill in a mere 2.5 seconds.

Us Indians will have to wait a long time to witness these hair raising numbers. At least until there are proper and stable policies and infrastructure in place regarding the EVs. For the time being, you can just check out the first Tesla Model X that landed in India here.
